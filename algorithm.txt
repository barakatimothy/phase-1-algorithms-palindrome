Algorithm

1.Function accepts a word.
2.Should not accept anything else rather than a string.
3.Should check the length of array.
4.Split the array into two parts.
5.Should check if thel first string and last string are the same.

pseudocode

1.Acccept string.   
2.Check the string length.
3.Split the string in half.
4.Check the first letter in both the pieces.
5.If the first letter in the first piece === last letter in the other piece && If the last letter in the fisrt piece  === first letter in the other piece return true.
6.Else return false.

Written Solution of code

This is a program that checks is a string is a Palindrome ie. can be written in reverse and still be the same thing eg. 'mom' or 'madam'
